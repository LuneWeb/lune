## Archival

before luneweb 0.3 this fork was being used for bundling since you can fake require paths using the GlobalsContext struct, but maintaining a Fork is just not very easy to do, so it's decided that LuneWeb is gonna do it's own implementation of require once there is need for bundling again.

## Changes from this fork

### CLI changes

$ Build

the `lune build` command can bundle multiple scripts

```shell
lune build path/to/script1.luau path/to/script2.luau path/to/scrpt3.luau
```

the bundler doesn't bundle `.luaurc` yet so it's not gonna work with custom aliases.

```shell
lune build path/to/*.luau
```

### Internal changes

$ GlobalsContext

this struct allows you to customize the global variables that are inserted by the lune-std crate, for now these customizations are limited to adding your own standard libraries and modulescripts to the require function

<br/>

A standalone [Luau](https://luau-lang.org) runtime.

Write and run programs, similar to runtimes for other languages such as [Node](https://nodejs.org), [Deno](https://deno.land), [Bun](https://bun.sh), or [Luvit](https://luvit.io) for vanilla Lua.

Lune provides fully asynchronous APIs wherever possible, and is built in Rust ü¶Ä for speed, safety and correctness.

## Features

- üåô Strictly minimal but powerful interface that is easy to read and remember, just like Luau itself
- üß∞ Fully featured APIs for the filesystem, networking, stdio, all included in the small (~5mb zipped) executable
- üìö World-class documentation, on the web _or_ directly in your editor, no network connection necessary
- üè° Familiar runtime environment for Roblox developers, with an included 1-to-1 task scheduler port
- ‚úèÔ∏è Optional built-in library for manipulating Roblox place & model files, and their instances

## Non-goals

- Making programs short and terse - proper autocomplete / intellisense make using Lune just as quick, and readability is important
- Running full Roblox games outside of Roblox - there is some compatibility, but Lune is meant for different purposes

## Where do I start?

Head over to the [Installation](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/getting-started/1-installation) page to get started using Lune!
